* [Stylus (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/),

To display custom css. No other addon. (Above) is all official links. 


Repo is designed to archive CSS for different sites. Simply a back-up save as you will.

I **attempt** to make all ***css code*** user-friendly. So you're capable of editing yourself if you're not that familiar. Though I don't always make it user-friendly. *sorry*
